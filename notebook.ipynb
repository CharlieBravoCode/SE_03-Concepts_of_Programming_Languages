    "### Variables and scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They act as containers for values that can be changed during program execution. Variables have a name (identifier) and a data type, which defines the kind of values the variable can store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoping refers to the visibility and lifetime of a variable within a program. There are two main types of scoping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local Scope: Variables declared within a function or a block of code have a local scope. They are only accessible within that function or block and are destroyed once the function or block is exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block have a global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere within the program and their lifetime lasts as long as the program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages also have other scoping rules, such as lexical (or static) scoping and dynamic scoping, but local and global scoping are the most common."

    "#### Primitive data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in a programming language. They are the simplest data types that can be used to create more complex data structures. The exact set of primitive data types varies between programming languages, but some common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative. Examples: 42, -3, 0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floating-point (float, double): Represents real numbers, i.e., numbers with a decimal point. Float usually has less precision (less number of decimal places) than double. Examples: 3.14, -0.003, 7.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boolean (bool): Represents a binary value, either true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Character (char): Represents a single character, such as a letter, digit, or special symbol. Examples: 'A', '7', '%'\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages may also include other primitive data types, such as byte (for small integers), short (for medium-sized integers), and long (for large integers), among others.\n",

    "### Type Systems\n",
    "A type system is a set of rules that a programming language follows to manage data types and their interactions. Type systems are important because they help catch potential errors during the development process and ensure that operations on data make sense. There are two primary aspects of type systems we will discuss: static/dynamic typing and type inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static/dynamic typing\n",
    "Static typing and dynamic typing refer to how and when a programming language checks the types of variables and expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static typing: In statically-typed languages, type checking occurs at compile-time. Variables have a fixed type, which must be declared explicitly or implicitly when a variable is defined. Examples of statically-typed languages include Java, C++, and C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic typing: In dynamically-typed languages, type checking occurs at runtime. Variables can change their type during the execution of the program, and there is no need to declare the type when defining a variable. Examples of dynamically-typed languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type inference\n",
    "Type inference refers to the ability of a programming language to automatically deduce the type of a variable or an expression based on the context. This is often used in statically-typed languages to allow the programmer to omit explicit type annotations, making the code shorter and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages with strong type inference capabilities include Haskell, Scala, and Kotlin. Some languages, like Java and C#, have limited type inference capabilities using the var keyword (Java 10+ and C# 3.0+)."
